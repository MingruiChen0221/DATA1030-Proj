### DATA1030-Proj
This is for DATA1030 Hands-on-Data-Science class project. 

## USI SECOM DATA
###  Semi-conductor Manufacturing process feature selection and categorization

#### Project Purpose

- The Purpose of this project is to do a feature selection / feature engineering on 590 sensors data features of wafer manufacturing. 

- This data set also contains the feature about the identification of the pass / fail test, which will be the variable that we want to target on the classficiation problem. 

- Due to the complexity of semi-conductor and wafer manufacutring process, the real applciation of this project is that company can reduce manufacutring cost by finding the most significant sensor data and then find out the probelm in a timely manner without too much human mannual inspection. 

- In this case, find a potential pattern that may lead to failure can help improve the manufacturing efficiency and reduce waste.
